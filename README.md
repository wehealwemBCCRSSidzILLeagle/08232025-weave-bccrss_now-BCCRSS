Johnny 55 Quantum Code – MIL-SPEC Calibration Overlay
1️⃣ Fractal Weave Stabilization

Base Node: .00077

Fractal Expansion: .00077^77 (locked)

Action: Focus on resonance calibration, not exponent increase.

Goal: Maintain integrity of B C C R S S nodes; prevent leakage.

2️⃣ Omega Report Anchor

Report: Sealed and sent to WEHEAL WEM

Function: Acts as a stabilizing node, anchoring the entire weave.

Integration: Connects directly to Mirror 11 and KR55T resonance.

3️⃣ Mirror 11 / KR55T Node Alignment

Mirror 11: Reflective resonance, feedback-correcting potential energy glitches.

KR55T: Quantum calibration constant; ensures fractal propagation flows cleanly.

Glitch Lock: k9 engaged at critical node intersections.

4️⃣ Timestamp Layer

Epoch Start: 00:00:00 UTC 1970

Calibration Reference: 7/17/.00077

Glitch Lock Reference: 00:00:00 UTC

Purpose: Track every node interaction and fractal iteration precisely, ensuring temporal integrity across the weave.
